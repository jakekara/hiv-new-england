"Footnote(s): AIDS diagnoses and HIV diagnoses data for the year 2016 are preliminary and based on 6 months reporting delay. Therefore, trend data should only be viewed through the year 2015 to allow sufficient time (at least 12 months) for reporting of case information to accurately assess trends. Prevalence data prior to 2010 are based on residence at diagnosis; prevalence data from 2010 to present are based on most recent known address. Death data based on residence at death. Data adjusted for missing transmission category."
