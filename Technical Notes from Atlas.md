About this Dataset…

CDC collects, analyzes, and disseminates surveillance data on diagnoses of HIV infection; these data are the nation’s source of information on HIV in the United States. Numbers and rates and presented based on the date of diagnosis of HIV infection and infection classified as stage 3 (AIDS) (from the beginning of the epidemic through December 31, 2016; reported as of June 30, 2017). This year marks the transition to presenting diagnosis, death, and prevalence data with no statistical adjustments for delays in reporting of cases to CDC. Data for the year 2016 are preliminary and based on 6 months reporting delay. Therefore, trends should only be assessed using data through the year 2015 to allow sufficient time (at least 12 months) for reporting of case information to CDC to accurately assess trends. Data have been statistically adjusted to account for missing transmission category.

Surveillance of HIV Infection

As of April 2008, 57 areas (50 states, the District of Columbia, and 6 U.S. dependent areas) had implemented confidential name-based HIV infection reporting. The Atlas includes data from case reports from 56 areas (50 states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) in which laws or regulations require confidential reporting by name for adults and adolescents (i.e., persons aged 13 and older) with confirmed diagnoses of HIV infection (including stage 3 (AIDS)) as of June 30, 2017. Data for the Republic of Palau are not currently included in the Atlas.

After the removal of personally identifiable information, data from these reports were submitted to CDC. Although AIDS cases have been reported to CDC since 1981, the implementation of HIV infection reporting has differed from state to state. All states, the District of Columbia, and 6 U.S. dependent areas had fully implemented name-based HIV infection reporting by April 2008.

Data on diagnoses of HIV infection should be interpreted with caution. Data may not be representative of all persons with HIV because not all infected persons have been tested. Also, many states offer anonymous testing; the results of anonymous tests are not reported to the confidential name-based HIV registries of state and local health departments. The data presented in the Atlas provide minimum number of persons for whom HIV infection has been diagnosed and reported to the National HIV Surveillance System. In addition, because surveillance practices differ, the reporting and the updating of a person’s clinical and vital status differ among states. The completeness of reporting of HIV diagnoses is estimated at more than 80%.

Diagnoses

Diagnoses of HIV infection or infection classified as stage 3 (AIDS) refer to confirmed diagnoses during a given time period. For example, the 2016 data on HIV infection would include persons with laboratory-confirmatory evidence of HIV infection during January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and reported to CDC through June 30, 2017. Data for the year 2016 are preliminary and based on 6 months reporting delay. Therefore, trends should only be assessed using data through the year 2015 to allow sufficient time (at least 12 months) for reporting of case information to CDC to accurately assess trends.

Deaths

Persons reported to the national HIV surveillance system are assumed alive unless their deaths have been reported to CDC by state/local HIV surveillance programs. Death data include deaths of persons with diagnosed HIV infection or with infection ever classified as stage 3 (AIDS) regardless of the cause of death. Because of delays in the reporting of deaths, death data are displayed only through 2015 (HIV infection: 2008–2015; stage 3 (AIDS): 2000–2015). The exclusion of data for the most recent year allowed at least 18 months for deaths to be reported to CDC. Data are presented based on residence at death. When address at death was not available, the state where a person’s death occurred was used.

Prevalence (Persons Living with Diagnosed HIV Infection or infection classified as stage 3 (AIDS))

Because of delays in the reporting of deaths, prevalence data are only displayed through 2015. The data reflect persons living with diagnosed HIV infection at the end of each year during 2008–2015, or persons living with infection ever classified as stage 3 (AIDS) at the end of each year during 2000–2015. The exclusion of data for the most recent year allowed at least 18 months for deaths to be reported to CDC and for these deaths to be factored into prevalence calculations. Data are presented based on a person’s most recent known address as of December 31 of the queried year.

Linkage to HIV medical care after diagnosis of HIV (≥ 13 years)

Linkage to HIV medical care is presented only for states with complete laboratory data (at least 95% of laboratory results are reported to the surveillance programs and transmitted to CDC). Please see the table below for a list of jurisdictions meeting lab reporting requirements by year. Linkage to HIV medical care was measured by documentation of at least 1 CD4 or viral load test performed ≤1 month after diagnosis. More information can be found at: HIV Surveillance Report Supplemental Report Volume 22, Number 2.

Receipt of HIV medical care among persons ≥ 13 years

Receipt of HIV medical care for a given year was measured for persons living with HIV infection that had been diagnosed by the beginning of the previous year and were alive at the end of the given year. As an example, receipt of HIV medical care for 2014 were measured for persons with HIV infection diagnosed by the beginning of 2013, as of their most recent known address, and alive at year-end 2014 in the 38 jurisdictions (see the table below for the list of jurisdictions) that reported complete CD4 and viral load test results to CDC at the end of 2016. Receipt of HIV medical care was reported only for states with complete laboratory data (at least 95% of laboratory results are reported to the surveillance programs and transmitted to CDC). Please see the table below for a list of jurisdictions meeting lab reporting requirements by year. Receipt of any HIV medical care for a given year was measured by documentation of ≥1 CD4 or viral load tests performed during the year. More information can be found at: HIV Surveillance Report Supplemental Report Volume 22, Number 2.

HIV viral suppression among persons ≥ 13 years

Viral suppression for a given year was measured for persons living with HIV infection that had been diagnosed by the beginning of the previous year and were alive at the end of the given year. As an example, viral suppression measures for 2014 were measured for persons with HIV infection diagnosed by the beginning of 2013, as of their most recent known address, and alive at year-end 2014 in the 38 jurisdictions (see the table below for the list of jurisdictions) that reported complete CD4 and viral load test results to CDC at the end of 2016. Viral suppression was defined as a viral load result of <200 copies/mL at the most recent viral load test during the previous year. The cutoff value of <200 copies/mL was based on the following definition of viral failure: viral load of ≥ 200 copies/mL. If multiple viral load tests were performed during the same month and could therefore qualify as “most recent,” the highest viral load (most severe) was selected. If the numerical result was missing or the result was a logarithmic value, the interpretation of the result (e.g., below limit) was used to determine viral suppression. Viral failure may indicate lack of adherence to ART. More information can be found at: HIV Surveillance Report Supplemental Report Volume 22, Number 2.

Diagnosed infections among persons living with HIV infection

HIV diagnoses were based on HIV surveillance data reported to CDC from 50 states and the District of Columbia for persons aged ≥ 13 years. For methods determining estimates for undiagnosed HIV infection, please see the technical notes for Estimated HIV prevalence. More information can be found at: HIV Surveillance Report Supplemental Report Volume 23, Number 1.

Estimated HIV incidence and prevalence (diagnosed and undiagnosed)

The estimates of the incidence and prevalence of HIV infection (diagnosed and undiagnosed) among adults and adolescents were obtained in the following steps:

    Among all HIV diagnoses reported by states to the CDC, the date of HIV infection was estimated for each person with a CD4 test by using a CD4 depletion model.
    The distribution of delay (from HIV infection to diagnosis) was then estimated and used to estimate the annual number of HIV infections, which includes persons with diagnosed and persons with undiagnosed infection.
    HIV prevalence, which represents counts of persons with diagnosed or undiagnosed HIV infections who were alive at the end of a given year, was estimated by subtracting reported cumulative deaths from cumulative infections.
    The number of persons with undiagnosed HIV infection was estimated by subtracting the number of persons living with diagnosed infection from the total prevalence.
    The percentage of diagnosed infections diagnosed was determined by dividing the number of persons living with diagnosed infections by the total HIV prevalence for each year.

To reflect model uncertainty, all estimates were rounded to the nearest 100 for estimates of more than 1,000 and to the nearest 10 for estimates of less than 1,000.

Cell suppression

Current data re-release agreements between CDC and state/local HIV surveillance programs require certain levels of cell suppression at the state and county level in order to ensure confidentiality of personally identifiable information.

State level:

A data suppression rule is applied if:

    The population denominator for 1-way and 2-way demographic/transmission category data is less than 100.
    Two variables are already selected from section X, then no further stratifications are allowed.
    Two-way demographic/risk stratifications for U.S. dependent areas (except Puerto Rico, for age and sex) are queried.
    Two-way demographic/risk stratifications for the race groups Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders (NHOPIs) and Multiple races are queried.
    Two-way demographic/transmission category stratifications for New Hampshire are queried.

Also, data are suppressed or aggregated to preclude arithmetic calculation of a suppressed cell.

County level:

    The population denominator is less 100 or total case count less than 5.
    HIV is queried for county-level diagnosis data, only totals are displayed for the 50 states and DC. No stage 3 (AIDS) data are displayed at the county level.
    HIV is queried for county-level prevalence data, only totals and one-way demographic/risk stratifications are displayed for the 50 states and DC. No stage 3 (AIDS) data are displayed at the county level.
    HIV is queried for county-level prevalence data, only demographic/risk stratifications for the race groups black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, and white are displayed.
    HIV is queried for county-level prevalence data, demographic/risk stratifications for transmission category does not include the “Other” category.

Data are suppressed in accordance with the county-level data suppression requirements approved by each state under a data re-release agreement with CDC. Data are suppressed or aggregated to preclude arithmetic calculation of a suppressed cell.

National data displayed in the Atlas may not be comparable to surveillance data published by individual jurisdictions. This is because: (1) CDC de-duplicates cases at the national level, and (2) national data have been statistically adjusted to account for missing transmission category.

Age groups

As mentioned above, the Atlas only includes data for adults and adolescents (i.e., persons aged 13 years and older). When comparing HIV data with STD and/or TB data, the HIV age group remains ages 13–24. For diagnosis data, age is based on the person’s age at diagnosis (HIV infection or stage 3 [AIDS]). For data on persons living with diagnosed HIV infection or stage 3 (AIDS), the age is based on the person’s age as of December 31 of the queried year. For HIV or AIDS death data, age is based on the person’s age at the time of death. Ten-year age groups are used with HIV surveillance data to ensure data security and confidentiality.

Race/ethnicity

In 1997, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) announced revisions to the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity. Starting with 2003, the HIV surveillance data presented utilize this new classification standard and the following racial/ethnic categories (each race category is non-Hispanic): American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, white and multiple races. (As that format was not available for data collected prior to 2003, data are not displayed for the years 2000 through 2002 for the race categories Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, and multiple races). For data on persons living with HIV infection or persons living with infection ever classified as stage 3 (AIDS), the Asian category includes Asian/Pacific Islander legacy cases (cases that were diagnosed and reported under the pre-1997 OMB race/ethnicity classification system). Persons of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity can be of any race. For HIV county-level data, only racial/ethnic groups black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, and white are displayed.

Unknown Race/ethnicity

Some HIV and stage 3 (AIDS) prevalence and death cases are missing information on the individual’s race/ethnicity. NCHHSTP AtlasPlus currently does not display these unknown racial/ethnic groups. Therefore if you summarize the data by race/ethnicity, they may not match the state and national totals present in AtlasPlus. See the table below for how many cases are missing from 2000–2015.

2013	45	1	976	4
2014	45	0	972	4
2015	45	0	967	5

Transmission category

Transmission category is the term for the classification of cases that summarizes a person’s possible HIV risk factors; the summary classification results from selecting, from the presumed hierarchical order of probability, the one risk factor most likely to have resulted in HIV transmission. The exception is men who had sexual contact with other men and injected drugs; this group makes up a separate transmission category.

Persons whose transmission category is classified as male-to-male sexual contact include men who report sexual contact with other men (i.e., homosexual contact) and men who report sexual contact with both men and women (i.e., bisexual contact).

Persons whose transmission category is classified as injection drug use (IDU) are persons who injected non-prescribed drugs.

Persons whose transmission category is classified as heterosexual contact are persons who have ever had specific heterosexual contact with a person known to have, or to be at high risk for, HIV infection (e.g., a person who injects drugs).

All other transmission categories have been collapsed into “Other.” The “Other” transmission category includes: hemophilia, blood transfusion, perinatal exposure, and risk factor not reported or not identified.

Data have been statistically adjusted to account for missing transmission category.

Rates

Rates per 100,000 population were calculated for (1) the numbers of diagnoses of HIV infection and the numbers of infections classified as stage 3 (AIDS), (2) the numbers of deaths of persons with diagnosed HIV infection and deaths of persons with infection classified as stage 3 (AIDS), and (3) the numbers of persons living with diagnosed HIV infection and persons living with infection classified as stage 3 (AIDS).

The population denominators used to compute the rates for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico were based on the Vintage 2009 postcensal estimates file (for the years 2000 to 2009) and the Vintage 2016 file (for years 2010 to 2016) from the U.S. Census Bureau. The population denominators for American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands were based on estimates and projections from the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Data Base. Each rate was calculated by dividing the total number of diagnoses (or deaths or prevalence) for the calendar year by the population for that calendar year and then multiplying the result by 100,000. The denominators used for calculating age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific rates were computed by applying the appropriate vintage estimates for age, sex, and race/ethnicity for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The same method was used to calculate the denominators for Puerto Rico, with the exception of race/ethnicity; these data are not available for Puerto Rico.

Because of lack of data from the U.S. Census Bureau and small cell sizes, subpopulation rates by age, sex, and race/ethnicity are not calculated for the dependent areas (except Puerto Rico). Similarly, rates for transmission categories are not provided because of the absence of denominator data (i.e., the denominator data used in this report come from the U.S. Census Bureau, but the bureau does not collect data on transmission categories).

Technical notes for Viral Hepatitis Surveillance Data

About this Dataset…

Viral hepatitis is caused by infection with any of at least five distinct viruses: hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV). Most viral hepatitis infections in the United States are attributable to HAV, HBV, and HCV. All three of these unrelated viruses can produce an acute illness characterized by nausea, malaise, abdominal pain, and jaundice, although many of these acute infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild disease. The reported number of new hepatitis infections is based on data from the 50 states, and the District of Columbia. Data made available to the Atlas includes counts of confirmed acute cases of viral hepatitis A, B, and C.

Surveillance of Viral Hepatitis Infection

As part of CDC’s National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS), viral hepatitis case-reports are received electronically from state health departments via the CDC National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) a computerized public health surveillance system that provides CDC with data regarding cases of nationally notifiable diseases on a weekly basis. The Atlas includes viral hepatitis data submitted to the CDC NEDSS by state and local health departments.

National surveillance for viral hepatitis (including hepatitis A, acute hepatitis B, and acute hepatitis C) is based on case definitions developed and approved by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and CDC. In 2010, reported cases of acute viral hepatitis were required to meet CSTE-defined clinical and laboratory criteria.

Limitations

NNDSS is a passive surveillance system and is subject to several limitations regarding acute and chronic viral hepatitis reporting. First, NNDSS was designed for reporting of acute infectious disease for which a single laboratory test (e.g., culture positivity) can confirm a diagnosis. This limitation is especially problematic for HBV and HCV; for example, an average of four documents or reports must be reviewed to confirm each case of acute hepatitis C virus infection. Further, follow-up of patients is difficult. With the exception of selected, specially funded sites, states and localities do not receive federal funding to support viral hepatitis surveillance. Finally, ‘data not available’ means that the data were not shared with CDC.

Missing Data

The number of cases of acute viral hepatitis reported to CDC from state health departments included in this report is likely an underestimate of the true burden of disease, because viral hepatitis infections are generally asymptomatic and less likely to be identified and reported.

Hepatitis A: The number of reported cases of hepatitis A (HAV) was 2,007 in 2016. The overall incidence rate in 2016 was 0.6 reported cases per 100,000 population. Actual cases are estimated to be 2.0 times the number of reported cases in any year. After adjusting for under-ascertainment and under-reporting, an estimated 4,000 hepatitis A cases (95% CI=2,800-4,400) occurred in 2016. After adjusting for under-ascertainment and under-reporting (2), the estimated number of new HBV infections in 2016 was 20,900 (95% CI, 11,900–51,200).

Hepatitis B: The number of reported cases of acute hepatitis B (HBV) was 3,218 in 2016; the actual number of acute cases is estimated to be 6.5 times the number of reported cases in any year. The overall incidence rate for 2016 was 1.0 reported cases per 100,000 population. After adjusting for under-ascertainment and under-reporting, an estimated 20,900 acute hepatitis B cases (95% CI=11,900–51,200) occurred in 2016. (Data for 2016 were unavailable for the District of Columbia, Rhode Island, and Wyoming.)

Hepatitis C: The number of reported cases of acute hepatitis C (HCV) was 2,967 in 2016. The overall incidence rate for 2016 was 1.0 cases per 100,000 population, an increase from 2015 (0.8 cases per 100,000 population). Actual acute cases are estimated to be 13.9 times the number of reported cases in any year. After adjusting for under-ascertainment and under-reporting, an estimated 41,200 acute hepatitis C cases (95% CI=32,600–140,600) occurred in 2016. (Data for 2016 were unavailable for the District of Columbia, Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Iowa, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Wyoming.)

Additionally, some viral hepatitis case-report data records transmitted to CDC are missing information on the individual’s sex, age, or race/ethnicity. NCHHSTP AtlasPlus currently does not display the total number of data records that are missing sex, age, or race/ethnicity. Therefore the summed totals by sex, age, or race/ethnicity may not match the national totals present in AtlasPlus.

Technical notes for TB surveillance data

About this Dataset…

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects, analyzes, and disseminates surveillance data on newly reported cases of tuberculosis (TB) disease in the United States. The Atlas presents TB case report data submitted from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands for the years 2000 to 2016. TB data are presented by year of disease confirmation, reporting area (state/territory or county), age group, race/ethnicity, sex, and whether or not the patient was born in the United States.

Surveillance of TB

Nationally notifiable TB surveillance data are collected and compiled from reports sent to CDC’s Division of TB Elimination (DTBE) by the TB control programs and health departments in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories.

Reporting Formats

Reports of verified cases of tuberculosis (RVCT) are submitted by the 60 reporting areas. In 1985, CDC began collecting individual TB case reports. The RVCT was expanded in 1993 in response to the TB epidemic of the late 1980s and early 1990s. CDC has maintained a dynamic TB surveillance case registry since 1993. In 2009, CDC expanded the RVCT again to collect additional information for each reported TB case in order to better monitor trends in TB and TB control. Reporting areas submit data to CDC via Public Health Information Network (PHIN)/National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS).

Cases

A case of TB is described as a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, usually characterized pathologically by the formation of granulomas. The most common site of infection is the lung, but other organs may be involved.

The clinical case definition for TB is a case that meets all of the following criteria:

    A positive tuberculin skin test result or positive interferon gamma release assay for M. tuberculosis complex;
    Other signs and symptoms compatible with TB (e.g., abnormal chest radiograph, abnormal chest computerized tomography scan or other chest imaging study, or clinical evidence of current disease);
    Treatment with two or more anti-TB medications; and
    A completed diagnostic evaluation.

The laboratory criteria for diagnosis of TB are:

    Isolation of M. tuberculosis complex from a clinical specimen, or
    Demonstration of M. tuberculosis complex from a clinical specimen by nucleic acid amplification test, or
    Demonstration of acid-fast bacilli in a clinical specimen when a culture has not been or cannot be obtained or is falsely negative or contaminated. 

However, not all cases of TB will meet the clinical case definition. For patients who do not meet all the above criteria but still have a high suspicion of TB, it is up to the provider to decide if the person has TB disease.

A case should not be counted twice within any consecutive 12-month period. However, a case occurring in a patient who had previously had verified TB disease should be reported and counted again if more than 12 months have elapsed since the patient completed therapy. A case should also be reported and counted again if the patient was lost to supervision for greater than 12 months and TB disease can be verified again. Mycobacterial diseases other than those caused by M. tuberculosis complex should not be counted in tuberculosis morbidity statistics unless there is concurrent tuberculosis.

Cell suppression

Data are not suppressed at the state level; TB data can be viewed in aggregate format or one-way stratifications (i.e., by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, or country of birth [U.S.-born or Non-U.S.-born]). At the county level, cells are suppressed where populations have <5 total cases. At the county-level, TB data can be viewed in aggregate format or by origin of birth.

Rates

Rates are expressed as the number of cases reported each calendar year per 100,000 population. Population denominators used in calculating TB rates were based on the US Census population estimates for 2000–2016. Each rate was calculated by dividing the number of cases for the calendar year by the population for that calendar year and then multiplying the number by 100,000.

Country of Birth

Non-U.S.-born includes persons born outside the United States or the U.S. territories (unless one or both parents were U.S. citizens). Beginning in 2016, persons born in the sovereign freely associated states (the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau) ) are reported as non-U.S.–born unless one or both parents were U.S. citizens.

Race/ethnicity:

In 1997, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) announced the revisions to the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity. Starting with 2003, the TB surveillance data presented utilize this new classification standard and the following racial/ethnic categories: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, white and multiple races. TB data from 2000 through 2002, uses the ‘old race’ categories (each race category is non-Hispanic): American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, and white.

Missing cases

Some TB cases are missing information on the individual’s sex or country of origin (birth). NCHHSTP AtlasPlus currently doesn’t display these unknown cases. Therefore if you summarize the data, they may not match the state and national totals present in AtlasPlus. See the table below for how many cases are missing from 2000-2016.

Technical notes for STD surveillance data

About this Dataset…

The CDC collects, analyzes, and disseminates surveillance data on STD diagnoses. The NCHHSTP AtlasPlus presents chlamydia, gonorrhea, congenital syphilis, and primary and secondary syphilis case report data submitted from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam for the years 2000 to 2016 and early latent syphilis case report data for 2003-2016. STD data are presented by disease, year of diagnosis, reporting area (state or territory), age group, race/ethnicity, and sex.

Surveillance of STDs

Nationally notifiable STD surveillance data are collected and compiled from reports sent to CDC's Division of STD Prevention by the STD control programs and health departments in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, selected cities, U.S. dependencies and possessions.

Reporting Formats

STD morbidity data presented in this report are compiled from a combination of data reported on standardized hard copy reporting forms and electronic data received through the National Electronic Tele­communications System for Surveillance (NETSS) for diagnosis years 2000 through 2015. NETSS phase-in began in 1996. For the years 2000-2002, some states submitted NETSS data, while others submitted hard copy forms. As of 2003, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had converted from summary hard copy reporting to electronic submission of line-listed STD data through NETSS. Puerto Rico converted in 2006. Guam and the Virgin Islands continue to submit via hard copy form. Hard copy form data are collected using form CDC 73.2638, which contains summary data for primary and secondary syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia by reporting state or territory age, race, sex, and source. . Although all states and the District of Columbia currently report chlamydia, gonorrhea, and non-congenital syphilis data in the electronic NETSS format, some areas continue to submit the case-specific hard copy form CDC 73.126 for congenital syphilis.

Race / Ethnicity

When specific race/ethnicity data are presented in this atlas, the following OMB compliant categories are reported: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White and multirace. States began reporting these OMB compliant race categories in different years. Therefore, specific race/ethnicity categories are presented for a state only in the years when that state reported 97% or more of its cases with OMB compliant race/ethnicity categories. In addition, when presenting 5-year trend data, only states that reported 97% of more of their cases with OMB compliant race/ethnicity categories for all five years are included.

Interpreting Rates of Reported Cases of Chlamydia

Trends in rates of reported cases of chlamydia are influenced by changes in incidence of infection, as well as changes in diagnostic, screening, and reporting practices. As chlamydial infections are usually asymptomatic, the number of infections identified and reported can increase as more people are screened even when incidence is flat or decreasing. Expanded use of more sensitive diagnostics tests (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) can also increase the number of infections identified and reported independent of increases in incidence. Additionally, increasing use of electronic laboratory reporting has likely increased the proportion of diagnosed cases that are reported. Consequently, an increasing chlamydia case rate may reflect increases in incidence of infection, screening coverage, and use of more sensitive tests, as well as more complete reporting. Likewise, decreases in chlamydia case rates may suggest decreases in incidence of infection or screening coverage.

Cases

Cases of a given STD refer to confirmed diagnoses during a given time period. For example, the 2012 data on gonorrhea infection would include persons with laboratory-confirmed Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection diagnosed between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2012 and reported to CDC through July 7, 2013.

Cell suppression: In the absence of direct data re-release agreements between CDC and the jurisdictions governing STD data, CDC follows the 1996 Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) data re-release rules for STD data. For STD data, the data suppression rule is applied when the numerator for a given state is 3 or less. When suppressed, data are only displayed by state totals and breakdown by demographic characteristics is not permitted. Display of county-level data is limited to total rate or case count, with no demographic breakdown.

Rates

Rates per 100,000 population were calculated for each STD. The population denominators used to compute these rates for the 50 states and the District of Columbia were based on the U.S. Census Bureau population estimates utilizing the OMB compliant race categories. Each rate was calculated by dividing the number of cases for the calendar year by the population for that calendar year and then multiplying the number by 100,000. Denominator data for Puerto Rico consist of unmodified estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau aggregated by year, age group, and sex. Race/ethnicity-specific population data are not available for Puerto Rico. No denominator data are available for the Virgin Islands and Guam.

Natality data from the NCHS is used to calculate congenital syphilis rates at the national- and state- levels per 100,000 live births. County-level rates are not available for congenital syphilis.

Technical notes for the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)

Uninsured

This indicator is based on data from the American Community Survey (ACS). People who had no reported health coverage, or those whose only health coverage was Indian Health Service, were considered uninsured. For reporting purposes, the Census Bureau broadly classifies health insurance coverage as private health insurance or public coverage. Private health insurance is a plan provided through an employer or union, a plan purchased by an individual from a private company, or TRICARE or other military health care. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in parts a, b, or e were considered to have private health insurance. Public health coverage includes the federal programs Medicare, Medicaid, and VA Health Care (provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs); the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); and individual state health plans. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in c, d, or f were considered to have public coverage. The types of health insurance are not mutually exclusive; people may be covered by more than one at the same time. More information can be found at: 2015 ACS Subject Definitions.

Vacant housing

This indicator is based on data from the American Community Survey (ACS). Vacant housing units are houses that no one is living in at the time of the interview. Units occupied at the time of interview entirely by persons who are staying two months or less and who have a more permanent residence elsewhere are considered to be temporarily occupied, and are classified as “vacant.” New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place. Vacant units are excluded from the housing inventory if they are open to the elements, that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished. More information can be found at: 2015 ACS Subject Definitions.

Population 25 years and older w/o HS diploma

This indicator included people aged 25 or older who did not complete high school (or its equivalent) or higher. The data on educational level were obtained from answers to questions on educational attainment, which are tabulated for people 18 years and over collected in the American Community Survey (ACS). This indicator, however, is restricted to those aged 25 or older. The respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question also included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received. More information can be found at: 2015 ACS Subject Definitions.

Households living below the federal poverty level

Poverty status of households were obtained from the responses to questions on income in the American Community Survey (ACS). In the ACS, households are categorized as poor when the total income of the householder’s family is below the designated poverty threshold by the federal government. Thresholds vary by number of persons living in the household. For example, in 2015, the federal poverty threshold for the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia for a family of four was $24,250 (2015 Poverty Guidelines). For nonfamily householders, their own income is compared with the federal threshold. The income of people living in the household who are unrelated to the householder is not considered when determining the poverty status of a household, nor does their presence affect the family size in determining the appropriate threshold. More information can be found at: 2015 ACS Subject Definitions.

Population living in a rural area

This indicator is based on data obtained from the 2010 census. Rural area consists of all territory, population, and housing units located outside urbanized areas (UAs) and urban clusters (UCs). The Census Bureau classified as urban all territory, population, and housing units located within UAs and UCs, both defined using the same criteria. The Census Bureau delineates UA and UC boundaries that represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses. In general, this territory consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the “urban footprint.” For the 2010 Census, the urban and rural classification was applied to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Urbanized Areas (UAs) — An urbanized area consists of densely developed territory that contains 50,000 or more people. The Census Bureau delineates UAs to provide a better separation of urban and rural territory, population, and housing in the vicinity of large places.

Urban Clusters (UCs) — An urban cluster consists of densely developed territory that has at least 2,500 people but fewer than 50,000 people. The Census Bureau first introduced the UC concept for Census 2000 to provide a more consistent and accurate measure of urban population, housing, and territory throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. More information can be found at: 2010 Census Summary File 1.

Urbanization level: rural, suburban, urban

This indicator was based on data from the Economic Research Services of the United States Department of Agriculture. The urbanization indicator adopts and re-categorizes the 9 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes into Urban [codes 1–3], Suburban [codes 4–6] and Rural [codes 7–9] was used. The 9 codes were created by subdividing the official Office of Management and Budget (OMB) metro and nonmetro categories into three metro and six nonmetro categories based on the county’s population and contiguity to a metro area (see the table below). As a result, each county in the United States is assigned one of the 9 codes (see code definitions below), which allows researchers to break county data into finer residential groups, beyond metro and nonmetro. These codes were originally developed in 1974, and have been updated each decennial since (1983, 1993, 2003, 2013), and slightly revised in 1988. More details can be found at: Rural-Urban Continuum Codes

Rural
7	Urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, not adjacent to a metro area
8	Completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, adjacent to a metro area
9	Completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, not adjacent to a metro area

1- and 5-Year Estimates

The ACS continuously––on a daily basis––assembles data and then aggregates the results over a specific period (which may be 1 year, 3 years or 5-years). The data is collected fairly evenly over time, so that no particular week, month or year is over-represented within that period. As a result, they differ from point-in-time estimates. Additionally, because the multi-year estimates are derived from larger sample sizes, they are more reliable.
The multi-year estimates are more complete for smaller areas such as counties. Consequently, the 1-year estimates are used for counties and 5-year estimates are used for state and national. Users should be cautious when comparing the different period estimates. General information on the single- and multi-year estimates are available at: ACS General Handbook.
